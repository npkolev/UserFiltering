# Basic Interview Test
This is a simple React exercise that covers some basic React.

It should take around 30 mins to complete.

Currently the screens render hard coded data. These need to be updated to reflect what is inside mockUserData.
Go through these components, and wire things up so the interface works as per tasks below:

## The Task
These tasks are intentionally vague. Think about your previous experience and do what you are happy to submit. :-)

1) Use typescript for all props and add typings for the mockUserData.
2) Wire up components to use the mocked data.
3) We would like to be able to search for a user by name.
4) We would like to be able to check and uncheck a UserRow.
5) We would like to be be able to hide and show all the checked UserRows.
6) Show the relevant count of selected items in the toolbar

> We want you to submit code that you are confident would pass a PR from the rest of your team.
